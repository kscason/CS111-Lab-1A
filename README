All implementation is contained "simpsh.c".
Tested in lxsrv07.

Implementation for --rdonly, --wronly, --verbose, and --command.
Returns 0 if all options work, 1 if one fails.
If one option fails, will skip and continue with other options.

If verbose is called twice, it will print out "--verbose" for the second one.
If verbose flag it set and missing a rd-/wr-only file, then it will print
the error first before the option name.

Note that since we haven't implemented the --wait option yet, the parent 
process does not wait for the child process to complete.
So sometimes, the parent process finishes before the child process gets to 
actually execute the command. 
This does not result in a return error.
This will be fixed by implementing --wait, which is not part of Lab 1A.

The example given has --wait at the end, which guarantees that all 3 will run.
